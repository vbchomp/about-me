## LAB 2-5

## Project

Lab 2. Built a quiz for people to learn a little about me. Humble, I know. It greets the user and prompts for their name. It then requests they answer five questions. If they are wrong, it will alert with an error message. If correct, it will congratulate. The last alert thanks the user and asks them to come back again.

Lab 3. Added questions six and seven to test guessing and quess limits. Questions seven had the user guessing items from an array. Started tracking how many correct guesses the user gave overall seven questions and added to the goodbye alert.

### Reflections and Comments

* Lab 2. Bookmarking the Styling Scrapbook for future design questions. I think it will help as I try to make sites or applications that can be usable to everyone regardless of potential limitations from equipment like mobile devices or phycial limitations.

* Overall, I think this lab went well. I was a little lost with the css, as it has been 4 months since I finished my last class and with life did not study nearly as much as I had hoped to. However, the guys in Remo were awesome and helped out a lot.

* This took a lot longer than I originally expected because I kept coming back and fixing or embellishing before it was actually completed. Especially since I had probably 2/3 of it done before class was done. I think on the next lab I will get the bones done first, then come back to embellish and fix, with the timer going the whole time!

* It still trips me out to think that I created a web site. And I keep learning more each day to make it better.

* I think a stretch goal will be to figure out to get my pictures to have the caption displayed. It turns out it is not actually the title in the img tag.

* Lab 3. The JS for Lab 03 went surprisingly better than I was thinking. When I needed help, the TA would start describing and I was able to remember part of the way to get to the solution. So overall, it did not take nearly as long as I was thinking it would, especially after thinking we were not to do any of the JS beforehand. I thought it would take about 6-7 hours and it only took maybe 5.
